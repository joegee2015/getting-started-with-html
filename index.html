  <h1>My First ever Programming Course  (Introduction to Programming)</h2>

<p>The nanodegree program offered by Udacity online course, is  an ideal course for someone like me with zero knowledge in programming.  I decided to learn this course for very different reason (and hopefully all the advanced course too to develop my career further). I choose this course from the perspective  of my entrepreneur mindset where I would like to do something different what I am doing now (I am civil engineer entrepreneur running my own SME).</p> 
<p>I hope it will equips with all the knowledge and skills that professional programmers use whether  programming mobile apps, create web pages or analyze data by doing different short course project such as creating own web page from scratch and a portfolio of other programs</p>
<p>With all the guidance  of coaches and cohort, the mandatory requirement of projects can be completed on time.</p>
<h2><b>Review of HTML & Basics of Web</h2></b>
 Lesson 1:  Introduction to Web:I. The Basics of Web & HTML<br><br>
Web -  www - world wide web - the collection of HTML's<br>
HTML - The document type of web: Hyper Text Markup Language
They are made up of text content, references to other documents and links to other pages. 
HTML Markup - <NAME>contents</NAME> is made up of opening tag and closing tag in between the content, the whole Markup can be referred as Element.<br><br>
HTML Tags covered in this lesson<br><br>
a. Bold tag: <b>content</b><br>
b. Italics tag or emphasis tag: <em>content</em><br>
c. Anchor tag <a> - link<br><br> 
HTML Attributes
<TAG ATTR = "Value">contents</TAG>
Anchor - <a> - link 
href - attribute name
Value (here in this eg) "www.reddit.com"
<a href = "www.reddit.com"> derp</a>
eg: <a href = www.reddit.com">My Favorite<a/> - here "My Favorite" can be clicked to link reddit.com <br>
d. image tag 
<img src = "url" alt = "text"> - This is a void tag<br>
White space, Text on multiple lines<br>
e. br, break (also a void tag)<br>
f.  p, Paragraph  (is a closed tag)<br><br>

<b>Inline Vs Block</b><br><br>
break br - inline  but Paragraph p is Block
Where br tag use for single line text
eg: em, b, img tags
wheras Paragraph P is a block where around the text it contains invisible box that has height and width<br><br>
  <b>Span Vs Div - examples of Inline Vs Block</b><br><br>
<span> class = "foo"</span> - inline - class can be "CSS" a separate language that can be used to style the documents
<div>class="bar"></div> - block<br>
  <h3><b>Conclusion</h3></b>Hyper links - links connect together the web, videos, music, images etc <br>
CSS & JavaScript - Styles<br>
URL -  How to refer the document <br>
HTTP - Protocol unites the web to run <br>
Web Application - Diverse<br>
II. The Major component of web<br><br>
People - 
Computer + Browser (Google Chrome, Safari, Internet explorer etc) - 
The Internet ( cloud) - 
Servers -  Hosting Files <br><br>
  <h4><b>Computers are Stupid ? </h4></b>
<p>Programmers have to be careful writing codes exactly the computer can understand, with correct syntax etc.</p>
For example, if we forget to close a <emp> tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what we had intended to make italicize. This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, and it's a human error for not putting the closing tag.
